# Astronomer Resource Provider

The Astronomer Resource Provider lets you manage [astronomer](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/astronomer/) resources as

This provider is a bridged version of the [terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/GK-Consulting/astronomer/latest/docs/resources/workspace). The
